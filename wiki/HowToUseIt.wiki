#summary How to use it

= Introduction =

There are two typical way to use this products: single and periodical dispatch.

= Usage =

After installation you have a 'bin' directory containing these scrips:

  * generate

        take a directory containing the configuration to generate the mails for
        maildrophost. The newsletter.cfg must containing the path to 'spool'
        directory of maildrophost instance.

      options:

        -h, --help

            Show this help message and exit

        -a {{{<address>}}}, --address {{{<address>}}}

            Generate mail to specified address

        -f, --force

            Force generation of mails. Override control on generated.info file

        -c, --container

            Treat the path as a container of newsletter configurations.

        -p, --purge  Remove emails

            This option is used to remove mails from the csv file, this is useful
            in case of periodical dispatching to avoid to send again the mails.
            (with date and generated.info file this option is obsolete)

  * maildrophost

        it is the daemon that send emails. The commands are: start, stop, restart.

== Configuration file ==

The newsletter folder must contain a 'newsletter.cfg' file. The file is a
configuration file (same as INI files), for example:

{{{
    [default]
    mfrom = riccardo@reflab.it
    subject = Newsletter Test.
    txt = mail_body.txt
    html = newsletter_path.html
    spool = /tmp/kde-axa
    mails = mails.csv
    date = 2010/01/27 13:00
}}}

where:

  mfrom: mail from address

  subject: the subject of the mail

  txt: the file containing the text version

  html: the file containing the html version

  spool: the path to the spool directory of maildrophost

  mails: a csv file with the mail of the users (must have a 'mail' column)

  date: the date when the newsletter mails must be generate (optional)

    After generation a file 'generated.info' is created in the folder and the
    presence will be checked each time the generate script is called on this
    folder.

== Single dispatch ==

Activate maildrophost then call 'generate /path/to/newsletter/configuration'

== Periodical dispatch ==

Activate maildrophost then put 'generate -p /path/to/newsletter/configuration' in a crontab entry, for example:

{{{
# m h  dom mon dow   command
00 * * * * /srv/mailer/bin/generate --purge /tmp/a_newsletterconf/
}}}

or configure 'date' in newsletter.cfg and remove the --purge option.
